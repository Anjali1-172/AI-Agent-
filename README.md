## üìë Overview
The ocean covers **70% of our planet** and is essential for climate regulation and biodiversity.  
This project explores how **carbon credits** can be integrated into **marine conservation**, using AI to predict emissions and assess credit allocation.

---

## üéØ Goal
Support **Sustainable Development Goal 14** (*Life Below Water*) by creating a system that:  
- Predicts CO‚ÇÇ emissions from industrial data  
- Estimates carbon credits or deficits  
- Encourages funding for marine protection

---

## ‚öô Key Features
- **Data Input:** Industry energy, fuel, and production metrics  
- **Model:** Machine learning to forecast CO‚ÇÇ emissions  
- **Output:** Categorized emissions with credit calculations  
- **Automation:** State-based workflow and email reporting

---

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Langgraph, Yagmail  
- **Data Source:** Google Forms & Google Sheets  
- **Platform:** Google Colab  

---

## üöÄ How It Works (High-Level)
1. Collect operational data via Google Form  
2. Predict emissions using a trained ML model  
3. Compare results to allowable limits  
4. Report available/required carbon credits to users

---

## ü§ù Team & Leadership
This was a **team project** completed as part of the IBM AI Agent Internship.  
I served as the **Team Leader**, where I:  
- Designed the **system architecture** and managed workflows  
- Created the **presentation (PPT)** and consolidated project results  
- Divided tasks among team members and coordinated progress  
- Oversaw **system design** and **management** from concept to delivery  
- Strengthened leadership, communication, and project management skills
